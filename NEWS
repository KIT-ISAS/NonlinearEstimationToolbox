Changes in Nonlinear Estimation Toolbox 1.1
=============================================

* Added a Filter.step() method in order to perform combined time and measurement updates
* Added also a FilterSet.step() method
* Added new abstract base class BasePF for particle filters
* Added a Gaussian Particle Filter with combined time and measurement update (CGPF)
* Added the Auxiliary SIR Particle Filter (ASIRPF)
* Added unit tests for CGPF
* Added unit tests for ASIRPF
* Added unit tests for the GaussianFilter, SampleBasedGaussianFilter, KF, LRKF, and PF interfaces
* Added missing additive noise dimensionality checks to GPF the when dealing with AdditiveNoiseSystemModel or MixedNoiseSystemModel
* For better code reuse and reliability, EnKF, SIRPF, ASIRPF, and CGPF now use the same code for state predictions, and SIRPF and GPF the same code for likelihood evaluations
* Improved the numerical stability of the GaussianMixture logarithmic pdf
* Utils.resampling() and Utils.systematicResampling() now additionally return the indices of the samples that were resampled from
* Updated the Eigen linear algebra library to version 3.2.6
* Fixed bug in UKF.getSampleScaling()
* Fixed bug in L-BFGS C++ code
* Fixed bug in GPF unit test
* Updated GLCD MEX files for Windows and Linux
* Various code cleanups

* Bugs fixed
  - #3    Add the Auxiliary SIR Particle Filter to the toolbox
  
  
Changes in Nonlinear Estimation Toolbox 1.0.2
=============================================
