    %   getMaxNumIterations         - Get the maximum number of iterations that will be performed by a measurement update.
    %   getNumIterations            - Get number of iterations performed by the last measurement update.
    %   setConvergenceCheck         - Set a convergence check to determine if no further iterations are required.
    %   getConvergenceCheck         - Get the convergence check.
    %   setNumQuadraturePoints      - Set the number of quadrature points used for state prediction and measurement update.

        function obj = GHKF(name)
            % Class constructor.

            % Parameters:
            %   >> name (Char)
            %      An appropriate filter name / description of the implemented
            %      filter. The Filter subclass should set this during its
            %      construction to a meaningful default value (e.g., 'EKF'),
            %      or the user should specify an appropriate name (e.g.,
            %      'PF (10k Particles)').
            %
            %      Default name: 'GHKF'.
            %
            % Returns:
            %   << obj (GHKF)
            %      A new GHKF instance.
