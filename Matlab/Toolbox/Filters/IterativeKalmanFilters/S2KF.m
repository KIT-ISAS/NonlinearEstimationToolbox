            % Parameters:

            %      An appropriate filter name / description of the implemented
            %      filter. The Filter subclass should set this during its
            %      construction to a meaningful default value (e.g., 'EKF'),
            %      or the user should specify an appropriate name (e.g.,
            %      'PF (10k Particles)').

            %      Default name: 'S2KF'.
