        function obj = UKF(name)
            % Class constructor.
            %
            % Parameters:
            %   >> name (Char)
            %      An appropriate filter name / description of the implemented
            %      filter. The Filter subclass should set this during its
            %      construction to a meaningful default value (e.g., 'EKF'),
            %      or the user should specify an appropriate name (e.g., 
            %      'PF (10k Particles)').
            %
            %      Default name: 'UKF'.
            %
            % Returns:
            %   << obj (UKF)
            %      A new UKF instance.

        function setSampleScaling(obj, scalingPrediction, scalingUpdate)
            % Set the sample scaling factors for prediction and upate.
            % 
            % For example, a scaling factor of 0.5 results in an equal sample
            % weight for all samples, a factor of 1 results in a double
            % weighted sample located at the state space origin, and a factor
            % of 0 results in a zero weight for the sample located at the state
            % space origin.
            %
            % Note: a valid sampling requires a scaling factor larger than -N,
            % where N denotes the requested dimension of the samples.
            %
            % By default, the sample scaling factor is set to 0.5 for prediction and update.
            %
            % Parameters:
            %   >> scalingPrediction (Scalar)
            %      The new sample scaling factor used for the prediction.
            %
            %   >> scalingUpdate (Scalar)
            %      The new sample scaling factor used for the update.
            %      Default: the same scaling factor specified for the prediction.
            
            obj.samplingPrediction.setSampleScaling(scalingPrediction);
            
            if nargin == 3

        function [scalingPrediction, scalingUpdate] = getSampleScaling(obj)
            % Get the current sample scaling factors for prediction and update.

            % Returns:
            %   << scalingPrediction (Scalar)
            %      The current sample scaling factor for the prediction.
            %
            %   << scalingUpdate (Scalar)
