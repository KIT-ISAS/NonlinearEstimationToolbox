            % Parameters:
            %   >> name (Char)
            %      An appropriate filter name / description of the implemented
            %      filter. The Filter subclass should set this during its
            %      construction to a meaningful default value (e.g., 'EKF'),
            %      or the user should specify an appropriate name (e.g., 
            %      'PF (10k Particles)').
            %
            %      Default name: 'UKF'.

            % For example, a scaling factor of 0.5 results in an equal sample
            % weight for all samples, a factor of 1 results in a double
            % weighted sample located at the state space origin, and a factor
            % of 0 results in a zero weight for the sample located at the state
            % space origin.
            %
            % By default, the sample scaling factor is set to 0.5.

            %   >> scaling (Non-negative scalar)
