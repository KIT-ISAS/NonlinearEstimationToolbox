    %   copyWithName                - Copy a Filter instance and give the copy a new name/description.
    %   getName                     - Get the filter name/description.
    %   setColor                    - Set the filter color/plotting properties.
    %   getColor                    - Get the filter color/plotting properties.
    %   setState                    - Set the system state.
    %   getState                    - Get the system state.
    %   getStateDim                 - Get the dimension of the system state.
    %   getStateMeanAndCov          - Get mean and covariance matrix of the system state.
    %   predict                     - Perform a state prediction.
    %   update                      - Perform a measurement update.
    %   step                        - Perform a combined state prediction and measurement update.
    %   setStateDecompDim           - Set the dimension of the unobservable part of the system state.
    %   getStateDecompDim           - Get the dimension of the unobservable part of the system state.
    %   setPredictionPostProcessing - Set a post-processing method for the state prediction.
    %   getPredictionPostProcessing - Get the post-processing method for the state prediction.
    %   setUpdatePostProcessing     - Set a post-processing method for the measurement update.
    %   getUpdatePostProcessing     - Get the post-processing method for the measurement update.
    %   setMeasGatingThreshold      - Set the measurement gating threshold.
    %   getMeasGatingThreshold      - Get the measurement gating threshold.
    %   setNumRecursionSteps        - Set the number of recursion steps that are performed by a measurement update.

        function obj = ERUF(name)
            % Class constructor.

            % Parameters:
            %   >> name (Char)
            %      An appropriate filter name / description of the implemented
            %      filter. The Filter subclass should set this during its
            %      construction to a meaningful default value (e.g., 'EKF'),
            %      or the user should specify an appropriate name (e.g.,
            %      'PF (10k Particles)').
            %
            %      Default name: 'ERUF'.

            % Returns:
            %   << obj (ERUF)
            %      A new ERUF instance.
